We report a cooperative catalytic system comprising a PdII complex, XPhos, and the potassium salt of 5-norbornene-2-carboxylic acid that enables the use of epoxides as alkylating reagents in the Catellani reaction, thereby expanding the existing paradigm of this powerful transformation. The potassium salt of inexpensive 5-norbornene-2-carboxylic acid acts as both mediator and base in the process. This mild, chemoselective, scalable, and atom-economical protocol is compatible with a wide variety of readily available functionalized aryl iodides and epoxides, as well as terminating olefins. The resulting products undergo facile oxa-Michael addition to furnish ubiquitous isochroman scaffolds.
