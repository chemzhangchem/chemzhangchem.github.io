As a *provider of synthetic chemistry solutions* rather than a *traditional organic chemist*, I solely focus on solving synthetic problems as efficiently as possible, free from the pretensions and purism often tied to disciplinary boundaries.

Synthetic chemistry, as the science of creation, imposes no limits on the methods employed.

## About Me
Welcome to my personal page! I'm Jingyang Zhang, a fourth-year Ph.D. student at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), specializing in organic synthesis. My research focuses on total synthesis of natural products, data-driven, HTE-based reaction discovery and computational chemistry.  

Currently, I am working at Rice University as a research assistant. I moved here together with my PI to complete the remaining part of my studies.

## Research Interests
- **Total Synthesis**: The best training in organic chemistry and beyond.
- **Reaction Discovery**: Development of the method of methods.
- **Computational Chemistry**: Physical insights of organic chemistry transformations.
- **AI & Data Science**: Now it's already 2024...

## Projects (involvement indicated in parentheses)
1. **Total syntheses and derivatization of sannamycin A and sannamycin B** (leader, synthesis and computational studies)
2. **Reaction mining** (synthesis and coding)
3. **Second-generation Reaction mining** (leader, synthesis, coding HTE design and data science studies)
4. **Total syntheses of nimbolide and related natural products** (computational studies)
