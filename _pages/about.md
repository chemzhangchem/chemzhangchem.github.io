I define myself as a provider of synthetic chemistry solutions rather than a traditional organic chemist. I am only concerned with solving problems as efficiently as possible, without the pretensions and purism often associated with disciplinary boundaries. Chemistry is the science of creating something from nothing, and it never limits the means employed.

## About Me
Welcome to my personal page! I'm Jingyang Zhang, a fourth-year Ph.D. student at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), specializing in organic synthesis. My research focuses on total synthesis of natural products, data-driven, HTE-based reaction discovery and computational chemistry.  

Currently, I am working at Rice University as a research assistant. 

## Research Interests
- **Total Synthesis**: The best training in organic chemistry and beyond.
- **Reaction Discovery**: Development of the method of methods.
- **Computational Chemistry**: Physical insights of organic chemistry transformations.
- **AI & Data Science**: Now it's already 2024...


## Projects
1. **Total syntheses and derivatization of sannamycin A and sannamycin B**: Enantioselective syntheses of 2-deoxy-fortamine-type aminoglycosides.
2. **Reaction mining**: Development of a high-throughput experimental platform for reaction discovery.
