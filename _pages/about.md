## About Me
Welcome to my personal page! I'm Jingyang Zhang, a fourth-year Ph.D. student at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), specializing in organic synthesis. My research focuses on total synthesis of natural products, data-driven, HTE-based reaction discovery and computational chemistry.  

Currently, I am working at Rice University as a research assistant. I moved here together with my PI to complete the remaining part of my studies. After graduating with my PhD, I hope to work in the pharmaceutical industry. Having mastered, or at least understood, the power of chemical synthesis, biocatalysis, computational chemistry, HTE and data science, I want to know what new  insights the power of magnitude can bring me.

I focus on solving chemistry problems as efficiently as possible, free from the pretensions and purism often tied to disciplinary boundaries.

## Research Interests
