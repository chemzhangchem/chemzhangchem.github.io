Hello! I'm Jingyang Zhang, a fourth-year Ph.D. student at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), specializing in organic synthesis. My research focuses on total synthesis of natural products, HTE-based reaction discovery and computational chemistry. Currently, I am working at Rice University.

Research Interests
======
- **Total Synthesis**: Enantioselective syntheses of complex natural products.
- **Reaction Discovery**: High-throughput experimental platform development for discovering new reactions.
- **Computational Chemistry**: Utilizing computational techniques to predict and analyze chemical reactions and mechanisms.

Projects
======
1. **Total syntheses and derivatization of sannamycin A and sannamycin B**: Enantioselective syntheses of 2-deoxy-fortamine-type aminoglycosides.
2. **Reaction Mining**: Development of a high-throughput experimental platform for reaction discovery.

Contact
======
Feel free to reach out to me via email at jz111@illinois.edu or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jingyangzhang-chem/).
