Hello, welcome to my personal page. I'm Jingyang Zhang, a fourth-year Ph.D. student at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), specializing in organic synthesis. My research focuses on total synthesis of natural products, HTE-based reaction discovery and computational chemistry.  

Currently, I am working at Rice University.

Research Interests
======
- **Total Synthesis**: The best training in organic chemistry and beyond.
- **Reaction Discovery**: Development of the method of methods.
- **Computational Chemistry**: Physical insights.
- **AI & Data Science**: Now it's already 2024...

Projects
======
1. **Total syntheses and derivatization of sannamycin A and sannamycin B**: Enantioselective syntheses of 2-deoxy-fortamine-type aminoglycosides.
2. **Reaction mining**: Development of a high-throughput experimental platform for reaction discovery.

Contact
